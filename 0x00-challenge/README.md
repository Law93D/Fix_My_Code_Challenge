Fix My Code Challenge
This repository contains solutions to the "Fix My Code Challenge" tasks. The challenge involves fixing existing code snippets in various programming languages to correct their behavior.

Tasks Overview:
0. FizzBuzz (Python)
The provided FizzBuzz implementation in Python has a bug where it incorrectly prints "Fizz" instead of "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5. This task involves fixing the FizzBuzz function to correctly implement the FizzBuzz logic.

1. Print square (JavaScript)
The JavaScript code provided aims to print a square of a given size using the character 'X'. However, there is a bug that prevents the code from printing squares of the correct size. This task involves fixing the bug in the code to correctly print squares of the specified size.

2. Sort (Ruby)
The Ruby code provided sorts the command-line arguments passed to the script. However, there is a bug in the sorting logic that needs to be fixed. This task involves correcting the sorting algorithm to properly sort the input arguments.

3. User password (Python)
The provided Python code defines a User class with a method to check if a given password is valid. However, there is a bug in the implementation that causes the validity check to fail. This task involves fixing the User class to correctly validate passwords.

4. Double linked list (C)
The C code provided implements a doubly linked list with a function to delete a node at a specific index. However, there are several issues in the delete function, including incorrect pointer manipulation and failure to handle certain edge cases. This task involves fixing the delete function to properly delete nodes from the doubly linked list.
